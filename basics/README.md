# Shell, basics

In this directory, you'll find the Shell's project exercises that helps to learn topics such as: 

- Shell basics, what it is and how it works.
- Navigation within the environment.
- File handling.
- Use and operation of commands.
- Man pages.
- Keyboard Shortcuts.

Some of the basic commands to navigate, manipulate files or to look for help in the Man pages used here are, for example, `cd` (allows you to move between directories), `rm` (used to delete files) and `man` (provides reference information on topics, such as commands, subroutines, and files).

Each file contains the answer corresponding to the exercises proposed in the "Shell, Basics" project, developed as part of the Holberton School training.
