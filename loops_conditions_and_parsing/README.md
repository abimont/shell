# Shell: Loops, Conditions and Parsings

This project was developed as part of the Holberton School training. Each file in this directory contains the answer corresponding to an exercise, and explores how loops and conditions works in C language.

### Loops:

Loops allow us to take a series of commands and keep re-running them until a particular situation is reached. They are useful for automating repetitive tasks.

C language has three types of loops:

- for loop
- while loop
- do...while loop

*Simple syntax*

```
while [ condition ];
do
    # statements
    # commands
done  
```

### Conditions

The conditional statement is used in any programming language to do any decision-making tasks. This statement is also used in bash to perform automated tasks like another programming language, just the syntax is a little bit different in bash.

*Simple syntax*

```
if [condition]
then
   statement1
else
   statement2
fi
```
