# Shell: Permissions

On a Linux system, each file and directory is assigned access rights for the owner of the file, the members of a group of related users, and everybody else. Rights can be assigned to read a file, to write a file, and to execute a file, and are modified by the following commands:

`chmod`: modify file access rights
`su`: temporarily become the superuser
`sudo`: temporarily become the superuser
`chown`: change file ownership
`chgrp`: change a file's group ownership

Each file in this directory contains the answer corresponding to the exercises proposed in the "Shell, Permissions" project, developed as part of the Holberton School training.
